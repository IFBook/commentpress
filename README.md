Commentpress Plugin
===================

Commentpress is an open source theme and plugin for WordPress that allows readers to comment paragraph by paragraph in the margins of a text. 

Annotate, gloss, workshop, debate: with Commentpress you can do all of these things on a finer-grained level, turning a document into a conversation. It can be applied to a fixed document (paper/essay/book etc.) or to a running blog.

Please note: this plugin comes bundled with the official Commentpress Theme which will be auto-activated when the plugin is activated. If you are upgrading from a previous version of Commentpress, you should backup and remove the existing Commentpress theme from `/wp-content/themes` before activating the plugin.

For Wordpress Multisite: do not network activate this plugin. Consider using [Commentpress for Multisite](https://github.com/IFBook/CommentPressMultisite), which will handle the setup of sub-blogs for you.
