Commentpress allows readers to comment paragraph by paragraph in the margins of a text. You can use it to annotate, gloss, workshop, debate and more!

== Description ==

Commentpress is an open source theme and plugin for WordPress that allows readers to comment paragraph by paragraph in the margins of a text. 

Annotate, gloss, workshop, debate: with Commentpress you can do all of these things on a finer-grained level, turning a document into a conversation. It can be applied to a fixed document (paper/essay/book etc.) or to a running blog.

Please note: this plugin comes bundled with the official Commentpress Theme which will be auto-activated when the plugin is activated. If you are upgrading from a previous version of Commentpress, you should backup and remove the existing Commentpress theme from `/wp-content/themes` before activating the plugin.

For Wordpress Multisite: do not network activate this plugin. Consider using [Commentpress for Multisite](https://github.com/IFBook/CommentPressMultisite), which will handle the setup of sub-blogs for you.

For further information and instructions please see the [Commentpress site](http://www.futureofthebook.org/commentpress/)

== Installation ==

If you have downloaded this directly from the GitHub repository, do the following to install and activate the plugin and theme:

1. Unzip the .zip file and, if needed, rename the enclosing folder so that the plugin's files are located directly inside `/wp-content/plugins/commentpress`
2. Activate the plugin
3. Visit settings pages and configure plugin and theme
4. You are done!

If you have installed this from the WordPress Plugin Repository, everything should be ready to go: just activate, configure and you're done.
